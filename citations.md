### **How to Use These Entries in LaTeX**
1. Add the entries to a `.bib` file:
   ```bibtex
   @article{example_article,
     author = {Author Name},
     title = {Article Title},
     journal = {Journal Name},
     volume = {33},
     number = {4},
     pages = {12--34},
     year = {2022}
   }
   ```

2. Include the `.bib` file in your LaTeX document:
   ```latex
   \bibliographystyle{plain}
   \bibliography{references} % Assuming "references.bib" is the file name.
   ```

3. Cite the entries in your document using:
   ```latex
   \cite{example_article}
   ```

### Citation Styles
- **`plain`**: Sorts references alphabetically by author.
- **`unsrt`**: Sorts references by order of citation in the document.
- **`alpha`**: Similar to `plain` but adds abbreviated author names and years to labels.
- **`abbrv`**: A compact version of `plain`.
