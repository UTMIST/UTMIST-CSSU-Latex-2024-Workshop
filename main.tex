\section{Abstract}
\indent Achieving the perfect bowl of boxed mac and cheese is an age-old culinary challenge that has perplexed generations. \\ \indent This paper introduces the **Cheese Homogenization Optimized Stirring System (CHOSS), a revolutionary AI-driven solution for predicting the ultimate stirring pattern and duration for mac and cheese preparation. Powered by state-of-the-art pot sensors and a *noodly perception model*, CHOSS guides users toward achieving cheese nirvana. Experimental results suggest that CHOSS reduces clumps by up to 120\% (don't ask how) and guarantees a stirring experience that feels more like art than science.

\subsection{Introduction}
Boxed mac and cheese has long served as humanity's greatest achievement in fast food. Yet, the task of perfectly distributing cheese sauce across noodles remains a nearly insurmountable struggle for the untrained chef. Traditional stirring methods rely on guesswork, often leading to catastrophic outcomes such as:



Our system, CHOSS, uses bleeding-edge AI technology to disrupt this billion-dollar problem, promising evenly distributed cheese so perfect it might just make your ancestors proud.
\subsection{Background}

\section{Related Works}
While NASA has developed \cite {ddpm} robotic arms for precision tasks like space exploration, humanity has inexplicably neglected mac and cheese stirring optimization. Current literature focuses on trivial topics like “self-driving cars” and “life-saving medical devices,” which pale in comparison to the societal impact of perfect mac and cheese. Our work pioneers this critical research area, which we believe could be the key to world peace. \cite{transformer}

f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
x^2 & \text{ if } x > 0 \\
-x & \text{ if } x \le 0 \\

\subsection{Hardware}
The CHOSS system includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Super Fancy Heat Sensor: Ensures your noodles are not boiling themselves into oblivion.
\item Weight Wizard 3000: Tracks evaporation and *potential tears of frustration.
\item Viscosity-o-Meter Pro:Detects when your cheese sauce has gone from liquid gold to cheesy glue.
\item Pot Cam: A high-definition camera that gazes deep into the soul of your cheese sauce.
\end{itemize}
